# Coding Skill

Interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. make sure the questions aren't obvious.

be very in-depth and keep interviewing me until there are NO concerns anymore. then, write the spec to a file.

## When to Use

- When the user requests something complex or rare
- When the user asks you to interview them
- When you run into code which isn't following CONVENTIONS.md and requires understanding of the underlying problem
